# OpenTelemetry Adoption Survey 2022

In August 2022 I ran an open survey that at time of publishing had 120 folks responding to eight questions around OpenTelemetry usage. 

The results of the survey are now available for you to use:

* Raw results in [CSV](2022-08-26-otel-adoption.csv) format
* Pre-formatted report in [PDF](2022-08-26-otel-adoption.pdf) format

I appreciate if you link back to this repo as the source of the survey but you're not required to.
