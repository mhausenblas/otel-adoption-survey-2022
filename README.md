# OpenTelemetry Adoption Survey 2022

In August 2022 I ran an open survey that at time of publishing had 120 folks responding to eight questions around OpenTelemetry usage. 

Find the results here:

* Raw results in [CSV format](2022-08-26-otel-adoption.csv) 
* A pre-formatted [report in PDF](2022-08-26-otel-adoption.pdf)

I appreciate if you link back to this repo as the source of the survey but you're not required to.
