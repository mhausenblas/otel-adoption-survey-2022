# OpenTelemetry Adoption Survey 2022

In August 2022 I ran an open survey that at time of publishing had 120 folks responding to eight questions around OpenTelemetry usage. Find the raw results in CSV format and a pre-formatted report in PDF here. I appreciate if you link back to this repo as the source of the survey but you're not required to.
